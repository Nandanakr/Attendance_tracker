# Attendance_tracker
I have tried to attempt a project on attendance tracking using face recognition. The original problem statement is to detect the face and compare it with the data set 
that includes all the employees. When the match is found it would be sent to the attendance list which includes the name and date. I am currently still working on this 
problem statement.

Scope for development:
Further developments that could be done is to include a register option for new employees, that will be capturing the image using face detection and add to the existing 
dataset of employees. Besides this confirmation emails or messages could be sent once attendance is recorded and notifications about late entries. I aspire to include 
these functionalities and make a fully functional website.
